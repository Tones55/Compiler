use java trees

iterate by char until boundries
    {},=,(),SPACE,+,-
track position at all times, be able to store position of boundries
find quotes with booleans

when a boundry, quote, character, digit, symbol, or explicit identifier is found we know that it is a complete token

add to tokens in clean up

focus on the code that recognizes and adds tokens
    make sure to do longest match

deal with spaces
    make sure after finding a token that lex begins at the boundry found to make it

change how storing a keyword works
    it will match all the way until the boundry is hit and add everything
    fixing RegEx could fix this

detect if $ is missing on final program and give a warning if store
warning for unterminated comments
