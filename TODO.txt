boolean are 1=true 0=false
strings are refrences, store at end of heap

track symbol table number with A HASH TABLE

when doing == comparison
    BNE means we can branch past block when condition fails
when doing != comparison 
    BNE means condition fails when result is true
    so branch to the block
    in between block and condition put an unconditional branch past the block




make sure != works for all scenarios

generate a message when a conditional is always true or false

lines:
    If_Statement: branch or skip code gen when condition is false
    Boolean_Expression: branch or skip code gen when condition is false

comparions with string literals

test every possible path through the code

check warnings

check printing boolean in a variable
