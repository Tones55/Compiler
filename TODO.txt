preorderEnumeration through ast
    write method for all possible code generating ast nodes
        addASTNode();
        currentASTNode.add
    big success

boolean are 1=true 0=false
strings are refrences, store at end of heap

track symbol table number with 2 iterators and backtrack list
    x saves next number
    y is current number
    iterate x when next Enum
    backtrack y when we go back

    OR MAYBE A HASH TABLE

when doing == comparison
    BNE means we can branch past block when condition fails
when doing != comparison 
    BNE means condition fails when result is true
    so branch to the block
    in between block and condition put an unconditional branch past the block

Possible Nodes:
    block
    print
    Assignment_Statement
    Variable_Decleration
    While_Statement
    If_Statement
    String_Node
    Sum_Of
    digitNode
    Boolean_Expression
    Boolean_Value
